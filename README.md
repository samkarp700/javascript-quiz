# Coding Quiz

In this application, you will find 5 questions created for beginning coding students. The quiz covers questions pertaining to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
At this time, when you click "begin," the timer will begin a countdown and questions will appear. 
Once an answer is selected, the user is notified whether that answer is Correct or Wrong. 
If the answer is the correct, they can click "next" to move onto the next question. 
If the answer is wrong, the timer deducts by 5 seconds. 
If the timer reaches 0, the user is notified that the time is up. 
While there is a high score page, the page is not fully available for the intake of high scores at this time. 
Additionally, there are some remaining issues when it comes to completing the quiz that I hope to correct and resubmit at a later date.
